--- DEPRECATED CODING CHALLENGE; DO NOT USE ---

Pindrop Tooling Team
Interview Coding Challenge

=== Introduction ===

Thank you for accepting the Pindrop Tooling Team coding challenge! The purpose
of this challenge is twofold: One, it gives you a ballpark idea of the type
of problem our team members could be faced with on a day-to-day basis.
Two, it gives us an idea of how you approach technical problems and write code.

The next section of this readme contains a technical explanation of the
challenge we'd like you to tackle. We designed this challenge to take
approximately 1 hour to complete. Depending on your skill level and existing
understanding of the technologies used in this challenge, you may take more or
less time. If you find yourself stuck or taking more than about 2 hours, please
submit what you have along with an explanation of where you ended up. We will
consider giving "partial credit."

=== Technical Challenge ===

Your solution to this challenge will be a github.com pull-request to this
project containing the code you write (and/or modify) to solve the following
problem. We designed this problem on Ubuntu 12.04, but you may solve it on
the OS of your choice.

The file 'rtp_gap.py' in this project is a simple script intended to identify
gaps in streams of RTP packets within PCAP files. For a given RTP flow, We
define a gap as one or more packets whose sequence number(s) are missing or
out-of-order. When we use 'rtp_gap.py' to analyze the file 'test/rtp_gaps.pcap'
(also in this project), we find that it does not identify gaps as we expected.

Please fix this project as you see fit so that it identifies RTP gaps as you
think it should. Include in commit or pull-request comments any assumptions
you need to make in order to complete this challenge.
